 * Given a Model in input, this function copies all its links
 * and joints to the model in output, except for links that recognized
 * as "fake links".
 *
 * The condition for a link to be classified as "fake link" are:
 *  * The link has a zero mass.
 *  * The link is a leaf, i.e. it is connected to only one neighbor.
 *  * The link is connected to its only neighbor with a fixed joint.
 *
 * Once a "fake link" has been identified to respect this two conditions,
 * it and the joint that it connects it to its only neighbor is not copied
 * to the output model, but a frame with the same name of the "fake link"
 * and with the same transform is added to the model.
 *
 * \note The definition of "fake link" used in this function excludes
 *       the case in which two fake links are attached to one another.

 * the inertia of the links that are connected by that joint, assuming the joint
 * to be in "rest" position (i.e. zero for revolute or prismatic joints). The links eliminated
 * with this process are be added back to the reduced model as "frames",
