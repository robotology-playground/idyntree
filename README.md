iDynTree [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robotology/idyntree.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robotology/idyntree) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/1uecfmyvxb2dujt9/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/robotology/idyntree/branch/master)
===========

iDynTree is a library of robots dynamics algorithms for control, estimation and simulation.

iDynTree is specifically designed for free-floating robots, but it is possible to use it also  with fixed-base robots.

iDynTree is written in C++ language, but thanks to [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) it is possible to use the iDynTree algorithms in several other languages. Support and documentation is provided in particular for C++, Matlab, Python and Lua. If you are interested in using iDynTree with another programming language, feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/issues/new) requesting support for it.

## Installation
iDynTree is developed in the context of the [CoDyCo](www.codyco.eu) European Project. For this reason it is usually installed throught the [codyco-superbuild](https://github.com/robotology/codyco-superbuild), an easy way to download, compile and install the CoDyCo software on multiple operating systems, using the [CMake](www.cmake.org) build system and its extension [YCM](http://robotology.github.io/ycm). For more informations on the superbuild concept, please check [YCM documentation](http://robotology.github.io/ycm/gh-pages/master/index.html#superbuild).

If you are not interested in installing all the CoDyCo software it is still possible to install iDynTree without installing the rest of the CoDyCo software. For this reason a superbuild to install iDynTree and all its dependencies is available at:
https://github.com/robotology-playground/iDynTree-superbuild . Please check the README of that repo for information on how to install iDynTree and all its dependencies. Note that the `codyco-superbuild` is much more used then the `iDynTree-superbuild`, so it may be easier for you (especially if people working on your lab already use the `codyco-superbuild`) to just use the `codyco-superbuild` for consistency. 

### Bindings
To compile bindings to iDynTree in several scriping languages, you should enable them using the `IDYNTREE_USES_PYTHON`, `IDYNTREE_USES_LUA`, `IDYNTREE_USES_MATLAB`, `IDYNTREE_USES_OCTAVE` CMake options.

Several examples for using the bindigs are available in https://github.com/robotology-playground/idyntree/blob/master/doc/geometric_classes.md .

Then, properly accessing bindings to iDynTree can require some additional steps.
#### Python
You should add to the `PYTHONPATH` enviromental variable the install path of the `iDynTree.py` file.
For a typical installation of the `codyco-superbuild`, this will require adding to the `.bashrc` a line similar to this:
~~~
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/src/codyco-superbuild/build/install/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/
~~~

#### Matlab
You should add to Matlab path the `{CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/mex` directory. By default this directory should be `/usr/local/mex`, or if you used a [YCM](https://github.com/robotology/ycm/) superbuild something like `SUPERBUILD_BUILD_DIRECTORY/install/mex`.
You can modify the installation location for Matlab bindings files using the `IDYNTREE_INSTALL_MATLAB_LIBDIR` and `IDYNTREE_INSTALL_MATLAB_MFILESDIR` CMake options.

#### Octave
You should add to Octave path the `{CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/octave` directory. By default this directory should be `/usr/local/octave`, or if you used a [YCM](https://github.com/robotology/ycm/) superbuild something like `SUPERBUILD_BUILD_DIRECTORY/install/octave`.
You can modify the installation location for Octave bindings files using the `IDYNTREE_INSTALL_OCTAVE_LIBDIR` and `IDYNTREE_INSTALL_OCTAVE_MFILESDIR` CMake options.


##### Matlab/Octave bindings modifications
All the other bindings (Python,Lua, ...) are generated by SWIG and compiled on the fly by the user,
by enabling the `IDYNTREE_USES_LANGUAGE` option. The Matlab and Octave bindings are an exception because they
rely on an experimental version of Swig, developed for providing Matlab bindings for the [casadi](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki) project. For this reason, usually the Matlab bindigs
are not generated by the users, but by iDynTree developers that have a special experimental Swig
version installed. The bindings code is then committed to the repository, and the `IDYNTREE_USES_MATLAB`
option simply enables *compilation* of the bindings. If you want to regenerate the Matlab bindings,
for example because you modified some iDynTree classes, you can install the experimental
version of Swig with Matlab support at https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/matlab (just follow
the first 4 points in the guide) and then enable Matlab bindings generation with the `IDYNTREE_GENERATE_MATLAB` options.
Currently we are commiting to the repo the matlab bindings generated with this commit of `matlab-swig`: https://github.com/jaeandersson/swig/commit/260ed47c4414e61c66ae84a639707b1fef916ba8 .
