iDynTree 0.11.2 Release Notes
=========================

Unless noted otherwise, the changes in this patch release were introduced in Pull Request https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/482 .

Bug Fixes
---------
* Fixed cache invalidation bug in the getFrameBiasAcc method of KinDynComputations. The internal
  cache used by getBiasAcc was never updated even if the method setRobotState was called, so the
  getFrameBiasAcc method always returned the bias acceleration corresponding to the first call to setRobotState.
* Fixed getBiasAcc method in KinDynComputations to take into account the effect of non-zero and non-parallel
  linear and angular base velocity, described in https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/issues/370 .
* Fixed compilation on 32-bit Windows ( https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/506 ).   

New features
------------
* The getFrameAcc method that returns the acceleration of a frame was added to the KinDynComputations class.
  As this method takes in input every time the robot acceleration, it is computationally expensive and
  is not suitable to be used for multiple frames in a tight loop. If you need a computationally convenient
  method to access frame accelerations, please open an issue.
* It is now possible to specify a non-zero bias base acceleration as input of the ForwardBiasAccKinematics function.
  This is convenient if the bias acceleration that is being computed is the bias acceleration obtained with the
  MIXED velocity representation.
