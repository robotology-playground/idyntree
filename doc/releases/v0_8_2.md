Bug Fixes
---------
* In the classes devoted to the external force-torque estimation, since https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/343 it is possible to have external forces that are completly estimated from external sensors such as skin sensors. If in a given submodels there are no unknown due to this, the pseudoinverse should be skipped ( https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/443 ) .
