iDynTree 0.12 Release Notes
=========================

Summary
-------
*

Important Changes
-----------------

#### `high-level`
* Added method to compute the inverse dynamics inertial parameters regressor in KinDynComputations ( https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/480 ).
KinDynComputations finally reached feature parity with respect to DynamicsComputations, that will finally be removed in one of the future iDynTree feature releases.

#### `inverse-kinematics`
* Added method to return the convex hull of the constraint on the projection of the center of mass (https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/478).

#### `optimalcontrol`
* Added objects to deal with linear optimal control problems.
* Added ``OSQP`` interface via ``osqp-eigen``.
* Fixed bugs in ``MultipleShooting`` solver.
* Added few lines of documentation.
* Added interface for ``ALGLIB`` and ``WORHP``.
* Multiple shooting solvers can use hessians of costs and constraints
* Taking into account also the sparsity pattern of constraints and dynamical system (both in jacobians and hessians).

#### `visualization`
* Added visualization of vectors.

#### `estimation`
* Added attitude estimator interface to estimate the orientation of an IMU, given the IMU measurements
* Added `DiscreteExtendedKalmanFilterHelper` base class
* Added `AttitudeMahonyFilter` implementation of an explicit formulation of passive complementary filter over quaternion groups
* Added `AttitudeQuaternionEKF` implementation
* All of the above addressed in the PR (https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/516)
* Added `getWorldFrameTransform` implementation in `SimpleLeggedOdometry` class
* Added a new version of `changeFixedFrame` in `SimpleLeggedOdometry`class. This can be used to set a desired homogeneous transformation for the fixed frame
* Added `bindings` for `AttitudeMahonyFilter`, `AttitudeQuaternionEKF`, `DiscreteExtendedKalmanFilterHelper` (https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/522)
* Added basic tests for the Attitude Estimator classes (https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/522)

#### `bindings`
* Added high-level Matlab/Octave wrappers of the iDyntree bindings (https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/530)

### `core`
* Fixed compatibility of `Span` with SWIG bindings compilation (https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/522)
* Added bindings for the class `Span` with the name `DynamicSpan` (https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/522)
* Added basic tests for `Span` (https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/522)

### `Model`
* Implement `getTotalMass()` method for Model class

### `yarprobotstatepublisher`
* Add `tf-prefix` and `jointstates-topic` options for the tf prefixes and ROS topic.
* `robot` option is deprecated, and replaced by `name-prefix`.
