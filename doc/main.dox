/**
\mainpage Welcome to %iDynTree

%iDynTree is a library of robots dynamics algorithms for control, estimation and simulation.

%iDynTree is specifically designed for free-floating robots, but it is possible to use it also with fixed-base robots.

\li Source code: https://github.com/robotology/idyntree
\li File an issue: https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/issues/new
\li Installation and Tutorials: https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/blob/master/README.md

%iDynTree is written in C++ language, but thanks to SWIG it is possible to use the iDynTree algorithms in several other languages. Support and documentation is provided in particular for C++, Matlab, Python and Lua. If you are interested in using %iDynTree with another programming language, feel free to create a new issue requesting support for it.

This documentation is automatically generated from the C++ headers, and
can be used as a reference documentation for the classes and functions
contained in iDynTree .

%iDynTree is divided in several parts:
\li  \ref iDynTreeCore "Core" :  Basic data structures for kinematics and dynamics of rigid bodies.
\li  \ref iDynTreeModel "Model": Data structures and algorithms for modeling articulated body structures.
\li  \ref iDynTreeSensors "Sensors" : Data structures for modeling sensors distribude on articulated body structures.
\li  \ref iDynTreeModelIO "ModelIO" : Function to read and write %iDynTree models and sensors to external files (such as [URDF](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf) or [iKin DH parameters](http://wiki.icub.org/brain/classiCub_1_1iKin_1_1iKinLimb.html#a76c93aae76bb0f7ef9470b81d0da0e26) ).
\li  \ref iDynTreeEstimation "Estimation" : Algorithms related to whole-body estimation.
\li  \ref iDynTreeRegressors "Regressors" : Algorithms related to whole-body dynamics identification.
\li  \ref iDynTreeHighLevel "HighLevel"   : High level interfaces to access algorithms contained in %iDynTree.
\li  \ref iDynTreeYARP "YARP" : Function and classes for simplifying integration of %iDynTree with [YARP](http://yarp.it/).
<br>

As iDynTree is mainly developed to support the research effort of [iCub Facility department](https://www.iit.it/research/lines/icub) of the [Italian Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.it),
some parts of it are activly developed and their interface can abroutly change between iDynTree releases.
Until this components are ready to be integrated in a proper part of iDynTree, we keep them in the "experimental" part of iDynTree :

\li  \ref iDynTreeExperimental "Experimental" : Experimental data structures and algorithms, whose interface is not guaranteed to be stable.
